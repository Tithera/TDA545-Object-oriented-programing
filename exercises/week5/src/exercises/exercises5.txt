**** Exercises week 5 ***

-   Exercises are helpful if you choose the harder version of lab4.
    Else they are not needed in labs, but of course increases your skills
    If new to programming probably should use these later as examples of harder problems.


Exercises
---------
1.  See Ex1SplitInteger. Split an integer into a sum of n random terms (return array or list).
    Example: Split 7 into 4 integers
    Some possible solutions
        [4, 2, 1, 0]
        [0, 1, 2, 4]
        [0, 2, 3, 2]
        [2, 3, 1, 1]
        [3, 3, 1, 0]

    Method must be reasonable efficient and have a reasonable distribution of the n integers.
